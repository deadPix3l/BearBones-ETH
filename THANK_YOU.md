# Thanks to the following projects

This project sits on the shoulders of giants.
This document serves to inform our users what it is based on,
and to show gratitude and recognition to the projects that came before
and enabled this one to exist.

## Scaffold-ETH-2

A fantastic building-block/template for react devs. Its incredibly powerful, useful and easy to use,
and is the direct inspiration for this projects' existence. While bearbones-ETH does not directly use
any of their react-code (at time of writing), we have copied their structure, and even their hardhat setup verbatim.
It feels disingenious to not shout them out for their work and the inspiration they've given me to create this.
If you haven't tried it, I highly encourage you to.

## Hardhat

One of the most popular and feature-full eth frameworks, they are our eth development environment of choice.

## WalletConnect
